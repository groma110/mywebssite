        <h3>Sport</h3>
        <p>Sport is where passion meets discipline. It’s teamwork, effort, and heart all moving in the same direction. Whether you win or lose, every moment on the field, court, or track pushes you to be better not just as an athlete, but as a person. It's about growth, respect, and the love of the game.</p>
        <br>
        <div id="dee">
            <p>My favourite sports team is Manchester United,which is one of the most famous football clubs in the world. Based in Manchester, England, the team has a rich history, winning numerous Premier League titles, FA Cups, and European trophies. Known as the Red Devils, the club has legendary players like George Best, Eric Cantona, Ryan Giggs, and Cristiano Ronaldo in its history. </p>
